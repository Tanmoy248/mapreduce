/**
 * In the novel “Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland” that you downloaded in the session 2, for each English alphabet a-z, 
 * write a MapReduce program to find the average length of words with their first letter as that alphabet. 
 * The counting operation should be case-insensitive and should not consider any punctuations into account, i.e. the words “So” “so,” and “so” should be counted 
 * as words starting with ‘s’ of length 2 each.
 * What is the average length of words(rounded off to the nearest integer) starting with ‘a’?
